Did you know that you can use your own XSL files for HTML  
transformation in Observation Manager? 
Just create a new folder under the installations xsl folder. 
Place your XSL file into the new folder and rename your 
XSL file to: transform.xsl  
Now select your XSL file in the Observation Manager menu 
entry "Preferences" (the name of your newly created folder 
will be used in the selection box). 
You're done! 
With every new HTML export Observation Manager will now  
use your own XSL file.
