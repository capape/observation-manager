Did you know that Observation Manager doesn't mess up your filesystem? 
No registry entries or the like are done by Observation Manager. All files 
can be found in the main installation directory. Only one small (~ 1kb) 
configuration file is stored in your users home directory under 
".observationManager" called "config"
